/*Write a program to create a class Job with three data members 
job id, job time in hours, and per hour rate that is wages of job. 
Include getData() to take input from user and displayData() to 
display details on screen. Overload binary (+) operator as a friend 
function and return integer that indicate total time for two job 
and overload (-)operator as a friend function and return integer 
that indicate difference between time of two job. Include main()
