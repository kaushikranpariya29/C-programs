/*Write a C++ program to create a class namely SoccerPlayer which 
contains data members such as a player's jersey number, numberof goals and number of assists. Include GetDetails and 
ShowDetails() as member function. Also overload (>) operator as 
friend function which compares two SoccerPlayers if the sum of 
goals plus assists is greater. Create an array of 11 SoccerPlayers,
then use the (>) operator to find the player who has the greatest 
total of goals plus assists*/
